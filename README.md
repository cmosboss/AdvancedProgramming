Okay so steps to get everything running in unity

1. Install Unity
2. Install Source Tree
3. Inside of source tree click Clone / new (here) http://i.imgur.com/VsNBI02.png
4. Copy paste the link to the clone URl from github or use this https://github.com/zocheyado/AdvancedProgramming.git
5. Pick any directory you want and hit clone
6. Open unity click open project, browse to directory you just cloned
7. File->scene then go to scenes folder and select default

This should load the game and the scene, you can test it by pressing play. if this works your almost there. Next exit the game and unity, now go back to source tree and you will see a area called uncommited changes when you click on this it will bring up the files you have changed

Then you will see all of the files you have changed below alone with a checkbox to stage the ones you want (stage means send them to everyone else) http://i.imgur.com/wFjQ2zW.png

After that you can type a message and hit commit this is like telling the program "I am ready to send these files off with this message" then you will notice a small red number on the "push" option on the top of your screen, do this and you will push your changes to everyone else.

GENERAL FLOW FOR GIT AFTER INITIAL SETUP

Open source tree

Pull all changes

Open unity

Make Changes

Save and exit unity

Open source tree and select uncommited changes

Select files and type message and hit commit

Press push to send everyone those files.

And that is it! basically you just pull before you work and push when you are done, its pretty simple once you get it setup.
